## What is zerobrew?

zerobrew applies [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)'s model to Mac packages. Packages live in a content-addressable store (by sha256), so reinstalls are instant. Downloads, extraction, and linking run in parallel with aggressive HTTP caching.

It pulls from Homebrew's CDN, so you can swap `brew` for `zb` with your existing commands.

## Performance

zerobrew delivers dramatic speedups — up to **5x cold** and **20x warm**.

| Package | Homebrew | ZB (cold) | ZB (warm) | Cold Speedup | Warm Speedup |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Overall (top 100)** | 452s | 226s | 59s | **2.0x** | **7.6x** |
| ffmpeg | 3034ms | 3481ms | 688ms | 0.9x | 4.4x |
| libsodium | 2353ms | 392ms | 130ms | 6.0x | 18.1x |
| sqlite | 2876ms | 625ms | 159ms | 4.6x | 18.1x |
| tesseract | 18950ms | 5536ms | 643ms | 3.4x | 29.5x |

<Note>
  "Cold" means the package isn't in the store. "Warm" means it's already cached.

## Why is it faster?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Content-addressable store">
    Packages are stored by sha256 hash at `/opt/zerobrew/store/{sha256}/`. Reinstalls are instant if the store entry exists.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="APFS clonefile">
    Materializing from store uses copy-on-write, meaning zero disk overhead.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Parallel downloads">
    Deduplicates in-flight requests and races across CDN connections.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Streaming execution">
    Downloads, extractions, and linking happen concurrently.
  </Accordion>
