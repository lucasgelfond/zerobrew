title: init
description: Initialize zerobrew directories
---

## Usage

```bash
zb init
```

## Description

Creates the zerobrew directory structure and initializes the database. This is automatically run by the install script, but can be run manually if needed.

---

## What It Creates

```
/opt/zerobrew/
├── store/      # Content-addressable package storage
├── db/         # SQLite database
├── cache/      # Downloaded bottles
├── locks/      # File locks
└── prefix/
    ├── bin/
    ├── Cellar/
    ├── lib/
    ├── include/
    ├── share/
    └── opt/
```

---

## When to Use

You typically don't need to run this manually. It's useful for:

- Resetting after a corrupted installation
- Setting up zerobrew in a custom location
- CI/CD environments

```bash
# Initialize with custom root
ZEROBREW_ROOT=/custom/path zb init
```
