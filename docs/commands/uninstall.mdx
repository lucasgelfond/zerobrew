## What Gets Removed

When you uninstall a package:

| Removed | Kept |
|---------|------|
| Cellar entry (`/opt/zerobrew/prefix/Cellar/jq/`) | Store entry (`/opt/zerobrew/store/{sha256}/`) |
| Symlinks in `bin/`, `lib/`, etc. | Database record (marked uninstalled) |
| Opt symlink (`/opt/zerobrew/prefix/opt/jq`) | Cache files |

<Info>
  The store entry is kept so reinstallation is instant. Use `zb gc` to clean up unused store entries.
</Info>

## Uninstall vs Reset

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `zb uninstall <pkg>` | Removes one package |
| `zb reset` | Removes all packages and clears the store |

---

## Dependencies

Uninstalling a package does **not** automatically remove its dependencies. This is intentional — other packages may depend on them.

To clean up orphaned dependencies:

```bash
zb gc
```

This removes store entries that are no longer needed by any installed package.
