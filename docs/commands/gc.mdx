title: gc
description: Garbage collect unused store entries
---

## Usage

```bash
zb gc
```

## Description

Removes store entries that are no longer needed by any installed package. This reclaims disk space from packages that were uninstalled or updated.

---

## Example

```bash
zb gc
```

Output:
```
==> Scanning store for unused entries...
    Found 5 unused entries (245 MB)

==> Removing unused entries...
    ✓ Removed a1b2c3d4... (sqlite 3.44.0)
    ✓ Removed e5f6g7h8... (jq 1.6)
    ...

==> Garbage collection complete
    Freed 245 MB
```

## When to Run

Run `zb gc` after:

- Uninstalling packages
- Updating packages to new versions
- Migrating from Homebrew (to clean old versions)

<Tip>
  zerobrew keeps old versions in the store for fast rollback. Only run `gc` when you need to reclaim disk space.
</Tip>

## What Gets Removed

| Removed | Kept |
|---------|------|
| Store entries not referenced by installed packages | Store entries for currently installed packages |
| Old versions of updated packages | Cache files (bottles) |
| Dependencies of uninstalled packages | Database |

---

## Disk Usage

To check how much space zerobrew is using:

```bash
du -sh /opt/zerobrew/store
du -sh /opt/zerobrew/cache
```
