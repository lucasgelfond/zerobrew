title: install
description: Install one or more packages
---

## Usage

```bash
zb install <formula> [OPTIONS]
```

## Description

Downloads and installs a package and all its dependencies. zerobrew resolves the dependency tree, downloads bottles in parallel, and links executables to your PATH.

## Arguments

<ParamField path="formula" type="string" required>
  The name of the package to install. Uses the same names as Homebrew.
</ParamField>

## Options

<ParamField path="--no-link" type="boolean" default="false">
  Install to the store but don't create symlinks. Useful for dependencies you don't need in PATH.
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Install a single package

```bash
zb install jq
```

Output:
```
==> Installing jq...
==> Resolving dependencies (2 packages)...
    oniguruma 6.9.8
    jq 1.7.1
==> Downloading and installing...
    oniguruma       ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   1.2MB/1.2MB    0s
    jq              ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   402KB/402KB    0s
    oniguruma       ✓ installed
    jq              ✓ installed

==> Installed 2 packages in 0.45s
```

### Install multiple packages

```bash
zb install wget git ffmpeg sqlite
```

### Install without linking

```bash
zb install openssl --no-link
```

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Resolve">
    Fetches formula metadata from Homebrew's API and builds a dependency graph
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Store">
    Checks if each package already exists in the content-addressable store
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download">
    Downloads missing bottles in parallel from Homebrew's CDN
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract">
    Streams extraction of tar.gz archives
  </Step>
  <Step title="Store">
    Moves extracted files to `/opt/zerobrew/store/{sha256}/`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Materialize">
    Uses APFS clonefile to copy from store to Cellar (instant, zero disk overhead)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link">
    Creates symlinks in `bin/`, `lib/`, `include/`, etc.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Warm vs Cold Installs

**Cold install**: Package not in store, must download

**Warm install**: Package already in store, instant materialization

```bash
# Cold install (downloads)
zb install sqlite
==> Installed 1 packages in 0.62s

# Uninstall
zb uninstall sqlite

# Warm install (from store)
zb install sqlite
==> Installed 1 packages in 0.15s  # 4x faster!
```

## Error Handling

If a package isn't found, zerobrew suggests using Homebrew:

```bash
zb install nonexistent-package
```

```
Error: Formula not found: nonexistent-package

This formula may not be available in zerobrew yet.
Try: brew install nonexistent-package
```

<Tip>
  zerobrew only supports core Homebrew formulas with bottles. If you need taps, casks, or source-only packages, use Homebrew.
</Tip>
