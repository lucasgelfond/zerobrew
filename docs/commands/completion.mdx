## What Gets Completed

After setup, you can tab-complete:

- Commands: `zb ins<TAB>``zb install`
- Subcommands: `zb completion <TAB>` → shows `bash`, `zsh`, etc.
- Options: `zb install --<TAB>` → shows `--no-link`

---

## Automated Setup

You can also use the install script for completions:

```bash
./install-completions.sh
```

This detects your shell and installs completions automatically.
