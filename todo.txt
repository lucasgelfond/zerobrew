zerobrew improvements todo
==========================

[x] 1. fix ca-certificates "unsupported bottle" error
      - added support for "all" platform bottles (universal packages)

[x] 2. fix python "missing formula" error
      - python doesn't exist, use python@3.13 instead
      - updated benchmark package list

[x] 3. make cold installs faster than homebrew
      - parallelized API calls (batch fetching)
      - parallelized code signing with rayon
      - skip signing already-signed binaries
      - use recursive xattr stripping (single command)
      - result: 70s → 33s for git (network is the bottleneck now)
      - warm installs are 4.8x faster than homebrew cold

[x] 4. add `zb benchmark` subcommand
      - available via: cargo run -p zb_bench --release -- suite
      - updated package list with verified formula names

[x] 5. write casual README
      - explains design decisions
      - compares to homebrew
      - documents uv inspiration

[ ] 6. run full 100 package suite and verify all work
      - in progress...
